# Behavioral-and-Cognitive-Robotics

This Repository is for Behavioral and Cognitive Robotics Course under supervision of Professor Stefano Nolfi and TA Geesara Prathap. 

## Setup:
These files are build in Docker and by using image from Geesara [docker-container](https://github.com/GPrathap/docker-containers) \
I have mounted the whole repository inside docker container.

### The Organization:
It will be as folders for every excercise and lab. \
In each lab there will be a readme file explaining the lab or its requirments. \
I will add afterwards a folder specific for the final project. 

For Installation and Setup you can look in the [WIKI][2].
